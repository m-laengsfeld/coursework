# About me – Maximilian Längsfeld

## Personal introduction
For years I've been delving deeper in deeper into the art and science of communication. First, by learning several languages through my studies at the college for translation and interpretation. Later, inspired by working as a freelancer, by studying the psychology of sales and influence. I'm now looking to combine this knowledge and experience by managing projects in the marketing and IT sector on an international level.

## First encounter with programming
We had a course in school where we built games with Scratch. However, I've pretty much always had a computer in my room since I was a little kid (even if it was just my brother's old PC which wouldn't even boot up properly). Ever since my teenager years I started to program here and there but never stuck with it...Until this year when I applied the lessons from language learning on programming and finally managed to stick with it and make it a long-term habit.

## Why did you choose your current course? What are you planning on doing with it?
I constantly deal with the web at work and am very curious about the inner workings of it at a deeper level. Web programming in an intense fashion over the next 6-12 months is the most direct path to where I want to go.

Where is that? I want to combine my skills in communication with my newly learnt tech skills to lead my team/company and develop innovative solutions for pressing problems.

## A time where you had to demonstrate perseverance
Through years of martial arts and yoga practice I've had to endure many challenging situations.

In terms of work, my longest project yet came in my days as interpreter. My colleague and I were hired to do simultaneous interpretation (English to German) at a prestigious, university level conference of veterianarian practicioners and researchers. We had to learn tons of new vocabulary and background information in order to provide a high-quality interpretation throughout 3 days. We prepared dilligently over the summer and delivered a great performance that allowed non-english speakers to follow the talks.

## What do you do for fun?
 Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Yoga, practice at the shooting range, read a book, travel, see a movie go for walks (especially though a new city).

## What is life like where you live?
Currently I live in Sofia, Bulgaria. Sofia is one (if not **the**) tech capital of Eastern Europe. There's a buzz in the city (especially during summer) and I like that. It's not too big (roughly 1.5m people) and has a good center for going out and amusing yourself with friends. However, in winter the city gets quite grumpy, icy and filled with smog on many days. I will probably stay here for another 6 months or so and then move on.

## One of the most enjoyable experiences you have ever had
 Riding a motorcycle through Southern India all by myself.

## Where you would travel if you could go somewhere immediately and why would you go there?
China (Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Shanghai) – I'm going to go there some day. I studied Mandarin for a while and am curious about the culture and the incredible buzz that must be going on in giant cities like these.
